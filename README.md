# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

In this project, I am going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. I am going to find the answers to questions :

-What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
-Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
-What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.




這個專案中，我將分析由世界銀行收集的國際債務數據。數據集包含了發展中國家在多個類別中欠款的金額（以美元計），我將尋找以下問題的答案：

-列出在數據集中包含的國家所欠款項的總金額是多少？
-哪個國家擁有最大的債務金額，以及這個金額是多少？
-不同債務指標下各國所欠款項的平均值是多少？
這個專案裡使用的數據由世界銀行提供，包括了自1970年至2015年間記錄的全球多個國家和地區的債務統計數據。
